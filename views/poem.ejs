                        Full are my pitchers and far to carry,
                        Lone is the way and long,
                        Why, O why was I tempted to tarry
                        Lured by the boatmen’s song?

                        Swiftly the shadows of night are falling,
                        Hear, O hear, is the white crane calling,
                        Is it the wild owl’s cry?
                        There are no tender moonlit roses,
                        A night’s high noon reposes,
                        Only the way lies free.

                        O, toiling heart, cease your beating,
                        Time there is for your fleeting,
                        Lo, I hear the boatmen’s song!
                        Lord of my heart, send a light to guide me,
                        Shine, O shine, ere the shadows hide me,

                    <p class="text-gray-700 whitespace-pre-line">
                        I remember the night my mother
                        was stung by a scorpion. Ten hours
                        of steady rain had driven him
                        to crawl beneath a sack of rice.

                        Parting with his poison—flash
                        of diabolic tail in the dark room—
                        he risked the rain again.
                        The peasants came like swarms of flies
                        and buzzed the name of God a hundred times
                        to paralyse the Evil One.

                        With candles and with lanterns
                        throwing giant scorpion shadows
                        on the mud-baked walls
                        they searched for him: he was not found.
                        They clicked their tongues.
                        With every movement that the scorpion made
                        his poison moved in Mother’s blood, they said.

                        May he sit still, they said
                        May the sins of your previous birth
                        be burned away tonight, they said.
                        May your suffering decrease
                        the misfortunes of your next birth, they said.
                        May the sum of all evil
                        balanced in this unreal world
                        against the sum of good
                        become diminished by your pain.
                        My mother only said
                        Thank God the scorpion picked on me
                        and spared my children.

                        <strong>Introduction:</strong> A.K. Ramanujan, known for blending Indian and Western sensibilities, reflects on childhood memories in this poem. It captures the innocence of rural life, the sensory richness of nature, and the cultural nostalgia of familial bonds, evoking the people and seasons of India.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 whitespace-pre-line">
                        When she was four or five
                        she sat on a village swing and
                        her cousin, six or seven,
                        sat himself against her;

                        with every lunge of the swing
                        they felt their bodies
                        beat against each other
                        and grow warm together;

                        when the swing slowed down
                        they went up to the low mud wall
                        and threw wet sand at each other
                        till their clothes and faces
                        were brown with mud.

                        Now when she goes looking
                        for her cousin in the city
                        she only finds tall houses
                        and men who will not play
                        with her on any swing;

                        yet the smell of wet earth
                        after a night’s rain
                        brings back that swing,
                        that cousin, that village,
                        and the feel of his body
                        against hers in the dark.

                        सागर-सी गहराई में, सपनों का अनघट स्वरूप।

                        पर्वत की गोद में बस्ती, छोटी-सी कुटिया,
                        जहाँ प्रेम की गंगा बहती, हर पल हर छवि पवित्र या।
                        बसंत में फूल खिलते, हेमंत में बर्फीली चादर,

                        In moonlit nights, the stars’ lamps gleam,
                        In ocean-deep silence, dreams weave their theme.

                        In the mountain’s lap, a hamlet, a humble hut,
                        Where love’s Ganges flows, every image pure and just.
                        Spring blooms with flowers, winter spreads a snowy sheet,
                        In every season, the Himalayas chant life’s precious beat.
