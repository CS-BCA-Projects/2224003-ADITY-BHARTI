        <p>The Hoysalas were an influential South Indian dynasty that ruled between the 11th and 14th centuries, with their kingdom centered in present-day Karnataka. Known for their remarkable architectural achievements, the Hoysalas are especially revered for their contributions to temple architecture...</p>
        <p>Among the most iconic Hoysala temples are the Chennakesava Temple in Belur, the Hoysaleswara Temple in Halebidu, and the Keshava Temple in Somnathpur...</p>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Halebidu Temple</div>
        <p>Halebidu, once the capital of the Hoysala Empire, is home to the Hoysaleswara Temple, built in the 12th century by King Vishnuvardhana’s successors. This temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, is renowned for its stunningly detailed sculptures that cover the entire exterior. The temple’s most notable feature is its depiction of a variety of mythological stories from Hindu scriptures, especially from the Mahabharata and Ramayana. The intricate carvings on the walls and pillars display scenes from royal court life, deities in dynamic poses, and detailed depictions of animals, making it a visual feast for those interested in ancient art and culture.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Somnathpur Temple</div>
        <p>The Keshava Temple in Somnathpur, built in 1268 AD, is another remarkable example of Hoysala architecture. Though smaller in size than the Belur and Halebidu temples, the Keshava Temple is no less impressive in its beauty and complexity. The temple's most significant feature is its layout, designed in a star-shaped pattern, with elaborate stone carvings that cover its exterior. The temple features a series of finely sculpted panels depicting scenes of Hindu mythology, from gods and goddesses to celestial beings. The three sanctum towers of the temple are dedicated to Vishnu, with each showcasing intricate artistry. Despite being slightly more remote compared to Belur and Halebidu, Somnathpur offers one of the best-preserved examples of Hoysala temple architecture.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Architectural Style</div>
        <p>The architectural style of the Hoysala temples, often referred to as the “Hoysala Style,” is characterized by star-shaped bases, large pillared halls, and multiple towers. These temples were designed to reflect the divine order and to create a sense of harmony and balance. The exterior walls of the temples are covered with countless sculptures that tell the stories of Hindu mythology, including the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranas, in exquisite detail. The temples’ interiors are equally impressive, with finely carved pillars, ceilings, and mandapas (halls), which showcase the exceptional skill of the Hoysala artisans.</p>

    <div class="section">

The temples built during this period reflect a fusion of various regional architectural styles, incorporating elements from the Chola, Chalukya, and other regional traditions while creating a unique Hoysala identity. The legacy of the Hoysalas continues to be celebrated today, with these temples standing as monuments to their artistic, religious, and cultural achievements. The influence of Hoysala architecture can be seen in later South Indian temple constructions, making these temples an integral part of the region’s history and heritage.</p>
