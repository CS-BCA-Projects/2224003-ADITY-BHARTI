      <p class="text-xl">
        The knowledge systems of ancient India encompass a rich blend of philosophy, science, spirituality, and logic. Rooted in Vedic traditions, Indian sages explored everything from the nature of the atom to the farthest stars in the cosmos. This page documents the legacies of key scientists and sages who made pioneering contributions in yajnas (sacrificial rituals), anatomy, space, and constellations — fields which we today classify as physics, astronomy, medicine, and ecology.

    <!-- Maharishi Bharadwaj -->
    <section class="mb-16">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">Maharishi Bharadwaj</h2>
      <p class="text-lg">
        Maharishi Bharadwaj, one of the revered Saptarishis, authored the ancient treatise <strong>‘Yantra Sarvasva’</strong>, a compendium of mechanical sciences, with a focus on aviation. This incredible text, cited in manuscripts like the <em>Vaimanika Shastra</em>, describes three types of flying machines: <em>Rukma Vimana</em> (golden aircraft), <em>Shakuna Vimana</em> (bird-shaped aircraft), and <em>Krishna Vimana</em>. Each was powered by a blend of solar energy, mercury, and gyroscopic propulsion. Bharadwaj divided aviation into 32 parts, including mirror-based technology, pilot training, clothing, and weather prediction.
        <br><br>
        In terms of **Yagya**, Bharadwaj explained how fire alters molecular structures, creating purifying emissions. He used geometry in altar construction to channel cosmic energies. Bharadwaj showed that yajnas affected atmospheric oxygen, rainfall, and even agriculture, well in line with today’s ecological awareness.

    <!-- Sushruta -->
    <section class="mb-16">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">Sushruta</h2>
      <p class="text-lg">
        <strong>Sushruta</strong> lived during the 6th century BCE and was the pioneer of surgery and clinical medicine. His epic medical work, the <em>Sushruta Samhita</em>, contains over 184 chapters and describes more than 1,120 diseases, hundreds of medicinal plants, and detailed anatomical observations.
        <br><br>
        Sushruta classified surgical procedures into eight categories and listed 101 blunt and 20 sharp surgical instruments, many named after animals and birds due to their shapes. Among his innovations were:
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
          <li>Rhinoplasty (nasal reconstruction)</li>
          <li>Extraction of urinary stones</li>
          <li>Cataract surgery using a curved needle (Jabamukhi Salaka)</li>
          <li>Detailed study of skin grafting</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        His anatomical knowledge came from human cadaver dissection — a bold method for that time. He classified bones, nerves, and internal organs. Importantly, he tied each organ and its function to the three doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha), showing the first integration of physiology and holistic medicine.

    <!-- Aryabhata -->
    <section class="mb-16">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">Aryabhata</h2>
      <p class="text-lg">
        <strong>Aryabhata (476–550 CE)</strong> revolutionized astronomy and mathematics. His magnum opus, the <em>Aryabhatiya</em>, divided into 4 sections, covers arithmetic, algebra, plane and spherical trigonometry, and astronomy.
        <br><br>
        He correctly stated:
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
          <li>The Earth rotates on its axis, causing day and night</li>
          <li>The moon reflects sunlight (not self-luminous)</li>
          <li>The concept of sine tables (trigonometry)</li>
          <li>Pi (π) accurate to 3.1416</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Aryabhata's eclipse theory discarded mythological interpretations. He stated lunar eclipses are caused by Earth’s shadow (Chhaya) and solar eclipses by Moon’s shadow. His calculations of the length of the year (365.358 days) were very close to modern values.
        <br><br>
        In constellations, Aryabhata used <em>Nakshatras</em> to explain motion of the celestial sphere. His work laid the base for the <strong>Pancha Siddhantika</strong>, later enhanced by Varahamihira.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Varahamihira -->
    <section class="mb-16">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">Varahamihira</h2>
      <p class="text-lg">
        <strong>Varahamihira (505–587 CE)</strong> was a polymath and astronomer, best known for his encyclopedic work <em>Brihat Samhita</em>. He integrated Greek, Roman, and Indian astronomical systems, showing a global vision.
        <br><br>
        His Brihat Samhita contains chapters on:
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
          <li>Astronomy and astrology</li>
          <li>Weather prediction based on stellar positions</li>
          <li>Architecture, gemology, hydrology</li>
          <li>Rituals and planetary alignment</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        He made detailed observations of eclipses, planetary retrogrades, and heliacal risings. His **constellation analysis** identified Rahu and Ketu as nodes of the Moon’s orbit (shadow planets), explaining eclipse mechanics.
        <br><br>
        Varahamihira’s hydrogeological texts predicted underground water based on vegetation, ants, and soil type — matching modern principles of groundwater mapping. His insights guided temple architecture and Vedic rites based on Nakshatra positions.

    <!-- Acharya Kanad -->
    <section class="mb-16">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">Acharya Kanad</h2>
      <p class="text-lg">
        <strong>Acharya Kanad (circa 6th century BCE)</strong> was the pioneer of atomic theory in the world. Founder of the <em>Vaisheshika Darshana</em>, Kanad proposed that everything in the universe is composed of atoms (Anu), which in turn combine to form molecules.
        <br><br>
        His atomic theory stated:
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
          <li>Atoms are eternal and indivisible</li>
          <li>They combine in specific ways to create matter</li>
          <li>Motion, heat, and sound arise from atom vibration</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Kanad introduced ideas of gravitational attraction, transformation of energy, and matter conservation — long before modern physics. He stated that <em>Yajnas</em> are not mere rituals but energetic transformations of matter that release purifying elements into the environment.

    <!-- Lagadha -->
    <section class="mb-16">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">Lagadha</h2>
      <p class="text-lg">
        <strong>Lagadha (circa 1400 BCE)</strong> was an ancient astronomer and author of <em>Vedanga Jyotisha</em>, one of the oldest known Indian texts on astronomy. It forms part of the Kalpa Vedanga and provides the basis for the Vedic calendar system.
        <br><br>
        Lagadha systematized:
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
          <li>Solstices and equinox calculations</li>
          <li>Lunar and solar cycles</li>
          <li>Planetary risings and retrogrades</li>
          <li>Nakshatra timings for Yajnas</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        His observations ensured Yagya rituals were conducted in harmony with cosmic rhythms, thereby enhancing their spiritual and ecological effects. His emphasis on constellations helped create accurate almanacs (Panchangs) used to this day.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mt-4">
        Ancient Indian scientists, far ahead of their time, bridged spiritual philosophy with empirical knowledge. Their works continue to guide astronomy, medicine, and ecology, making them eternal beacons of knowledge. The depth of their observation, the clarity of their principles, and the integration of science with dharma remain unparalleled in human history.

    <!-- Charaka -->
<section class="mb-16 mt-20">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">Charaka</h2>
    <p class="text-lg">
      <strong>Charaka</strong> was a court physician in the Maurya Empire around 300 BCE and is considered the father of Indian medicine. His work, the <em>Charaka Samhita</em>, is a foundational text of Ayurveda, focusing on diagnosis, prevention, and holistic health.
      <br><br>
      He was the first to develop a systematic approach to <strong>anatomy and physiology</strong>, detailing:
      <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
        <li>Circulatory channels (Srotas)</li>
        <li>Vital forces (Prana, Ojas)</li>
        <li>13 Agnis (digestive fires)</li>
        <li>360 bones in the human body (including cartilaginous structures)</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Charaka emphasized **mental health** and linked emotions like greed or anger to disease. He advanced the idea that diseases arise from imbalances in lifestyle, diet, and moral behavior. His treatment methods included Panchakarma, Rasayana therapy, and herbal formulations.

  <!-- Patanjali -->
  <section class="mb-16">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">Patanjali</h2>
    <p class="text-lg">
      <strong>Patanjali</strong> was a sage and grammarian who lived between the 2nd century BCE and 4th century CE. Known for the <em>Yoga Sutras</em>, he also contributed to <em>Ayurveda</em> and <em>Sanskrit grammar</em>.
      <br><br>
      In the context of **anatomy and consciousness**, Patanjali's yoga system describes:
      <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
        <li>Chakras (energy centers)</li>
        <li>Nadis (subtle channels of energy)</li>
        <li>Pranayama and breath-based control of internal functions</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      He believed internal purification (Antaranga) was as essential as external medicine. His system also improved respiratory, circulatory, and neural health — a precursor to psychosomatic medicine.

    <p class="text-lg">
      <strong>Bhaskara II (1114–1185 CE)</strong>, also known as **Bhaskaracharya**, was a brilliant mathematician and astronomer. His masterwork, the <em>Siddhanta Shiromani</em>, is divided into four parts: Lilavati (math), Bijaganita (algebra), Goladhyaya (spherical astronomy), and Grahaganita (planetary calculations).
      <br><br>
      Bhaskara predicted:
      <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
        <li>Earth's rotation</li>
        <li>Gravity and the idea of "object falling due to attraction"</li>
        <li>Infinity and zero division issues</li>
        <li>Elliptical planetary orbits</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      He calculated the time for Earth's rotation to be 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.1 seconds. He also described planetary conjunctions, eclipses, and occultations with advanced trigonometric functions. His daughter's name was Lilavati, and he wrote a math textbook for her using poetic riddles.
